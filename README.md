# CODE_APRIL
CODE APRIL was an initiative that brought people of different backgrounds and coding level together to partake in a 30-day coding challenge.  For each day, there were resources to study and tasks to complete. To mark the end of the challenge, participants were instructed to pick from two datasets and explore them with certain objectives in mind.
